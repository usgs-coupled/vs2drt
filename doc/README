	VS2DRT, Version @VERSION@, @VER_DATE@

VS2DRT is a 2-dimensional, heat- and reactive-transport simulator 
for saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow that is available for 
Windows and Linux. VS2DRT simulates constant-density unsaturated or 
saturated flow, heat transport, multicomponent transport, and a wide 
range of equilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions. VS2DRT version 
1.4 uses PhreeqcRM as the reaction module and uses standard PHREEQC 
input definitions.

A. Distribution files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following distribution package of the batch version of VS2DRT is available
for Windows and Linux:
    
vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.tar.gz       Batch version for Linux or Windows VS2DRT. 
                                         Requires compilation using CMake.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
B. Compiling, installing, and running the batch version for Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the IPhreeqc library, you will need:

	(a) CMake (build process manager)
	(b) C++ compiler 
	(c) Fortran 90 compiler

B.1. Download and install CMake

	CMake version 3.10 or later is required. CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/. 
	If you download the executable, CMake is installed when you execute it. 
   
B.2. Unzip the distribution file vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.tar.gz
  
	There are several ways to uncompress tar.gz files on Windows, but you may need
	to download some software. 7-zip is a free utility that	can be used. A git 
	bash shell will have gunzip and tar. A set of tools	GnuWin32 can also be used. 
	You will need to uncompress the file to make a .tar file, and then extract 
	file from the .tar file. 
	
	The directory phreeqc-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
	extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
	before extracting the files.

	The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
	shown to the right):
   
	vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@/
	   CMakeFiles/             Files used by CMake
	   database/               Phreeqc database files.
	   doc/                    Documentation.         
	   examples/               VS2DRT examples input and output files           
	   src/                    Source files
	   Testing/                Not currently used
	
Notes: (a) A compiled executable is not included in this distribution.
            
       (b) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the installation directory
           structure.
   
B.3.  Generate a Visual Studio solution
 
	CMake has many options other than Visual Studio, but here we assume that you are
	using some version of Visual Studio. On the first use of CMake, it may be
	necessary to close all Visual Studio instances.
 	
   Open CMake. 
   
      Fill in the top two lines:
         Where is the source code: 
            The top level directory (i.e. c:/vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@).
         Where to build the binaries: 
            A new directory. It is suggested that the name of the directory include
	        the characteristics of the library that is built, including the VS
	        version, 32/64 bit, and any parallelization, such as VS2012_x64_openmp.
 	
   Click Configure. 
      From the pulldown menu of the cmake-gui popup, select the 64-bit version 
      for your Visual Studio. Normally, the default radio button should be 
      sufficient. Click Finish.
 	
   Selected CMake options:
      (1) CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX--Sets the the install directory where the 
          library and header files will be saved. Default is 
		  C:/Program Files/vs2drt, but alternatively, the install 
		  directory could be in the directory used for CMake.
		  
	  (2) VS2DRT_BUILD_MPI--Clicking this check box causes compilation with
	      MPI (Message Passing Interface, multiprocessing) parallelization for
		  the chemistry calculations; chemistry calculations for cells are run 
		  in parallel. If you check VS2DRT_BUILD_MPI, 
		  you will need to have a version of MPI installed on your 
          computer.	By default, no parallelization is used. 
		  
	  (3) VS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP--Clicking this check box causes compilation with
		  OpenMP (multithreading) parallelization. The tranport calculations for
		  the elements will be run in parallel. The chemistry will be run in parallel 
		  by MPI, if VS2DRT_BUILD_MPI is selected, or by OpenMP if VS2DRT_BUILD_MPI 
		  is not selected (and VS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP is selected). By default, no 
		  parallelization is used. If you check VS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP, you will need 
		  to have a version of OpenMP installed on your computer; it is often 
		  included as part of the compiler. By default, no parallelization is used.
	  
   Click Configure until the screen is not red. If the screen remains red, you will
   have to deal with the CMake error messages.
 	
   Click Generate.
 	
   You should now have a Visual Studio solution file (.sln) in the directory chosen
   for the binaries (second line of CMake screen). At any point, you can delete the
   contents of the directory and start over. You can make solutions for different
   Visual Studios, or different options in other directories.

B.4. Compile and install VS2DRT
 
   Open the Visual Studio solution in the build directory defined in CMake.
 	
   The default configuration is "Debug". If you want a release version, 
	  change the configuration to "Release".
 
   Build ALL_BUILD. 
      VS2DRT is compiled.
 	
   Build INSTALL. 
      The executables, PHREEQC database files, and documentation are installed in the
      install directory selected in CMake (denoted "INSTALL" in the following
      descriptions).

B.5. Installed files

	INSTALL is used here to represent the directory where the program has been 
	installed.
	
   INSTALL:
      ???RELEASE.txt                           Release notes

C. Compiling and installing the batch version for Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the software, you will need:
   make
   C++ compiler
   Fortran 90 compiler
   CMake

A Makefile for your system can be generated with CMake, and the Makefile can be used to
compile, test???, and install the software.

C.1. Extracting the files

Follow the steps below to extract the files from a distribution tar file.

   Steps in extracting files                            Explanation
   ----------------------------------------             -----------------------------------
   gunzip vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar.gz     Uncompress the tar.gz file.
 
   tar -xvpof vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar    Extract files from the tar file.

   The directory vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.
   
The following directory structure will be created (the contents of each 
directory are shown to the right):

	vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@/
	   README.txt              This file
	   database/               Phreeqc database files.
	   doc/                    Documentation.         
	   examples/               VS2DRT examples input and output files           
	   src/                    Source files

Notes: (a) A compiled executable is not included in the Linux distribution.
            
       (b) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the installation directory
           structure.

C.2.  Change directory to the directory that was extracted from the tar file.

   cd vs2drt-@VERSION@-@REVISION@

C.3.  Make a directory, for example, _openmp.
    
   mkdir _openmp

C.4.  Change directory to _openmp.
    
   cd _openmp

C.5.  Run CMake

	Example for gcc and gfortran using 4 processors for compilation:

CC=$(which gcc) CXX=$(which g++) FC=$(which gfortran) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./INSTALL -DVS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP=ON ..
make -j 4
make install

	Example for Intel C++ and Fortran using 4 processors for compilation:

CC=$(which icc) CXX=$(which icpc) FC=$(which ifort) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./INSTALL -DVS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP=ON ..
make -j 4
make install
   
   Most common options:
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dir--specifies the directory for installation of the
    		library. Default is /usr/local, $HOME would install	to your home directory.
      -DVS2DRT_BUILD_MPI=ON--specifies that MPI (multiprocessor) is used for parallelization
	        of the chemistry calculations. A version of MPI that is compatible with your 
			compiler must be installed on your system.
      -DVS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP=ON--specifies that OpenMP (multithreading) is  used for 
	        parallelization of the transport calculations; transport of the elements
			is performed in parallel. If -DVS2DRT_BUILD_MPI is defined, then cell 
			chemistry calculations will be parallelized by MPI; if -DVS2DRT_BUILD_MPI
			is not defined (and -DVS2DRT_BUILD_OPENMP is defined), then cell chemistry
			calculations will be parallelized by OpenMP. (OpenMP must be included 
			with your compiler.) 
        
C.6.  Compile the vs2drt
    
   make [-j n]

   Optionally, use -j n--where n is the number of compilations make runs in parallel.

C.7. Install vs2drt
 
	make install

C.8. Installed files

	INSTALL is used here to represent the directory where the program has been 
	installed.
	
   ?????INSTALL:
      RELEASE.txt                           Release notes
      README.txt                            this readme file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
D. Running the batch versions of VS2DRT 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

	For reactive flow and transport, VS2DRT requires three files: (1) 
	vs2drt.dat, which defines grid, flow and transport parameters, and 
	index numbers of initial and bounday conditions; (2) a PHREEQC input 
	file, which defines reactions and solution compositions of initial 
	conditions and boundary conditions identified by index numbers; and 
	(3) a thermodynamic database file. The PHREEQC input file and the 
	database to be used are defined in the vs2drt.dat file. Index numbers 
	are used in the vs2drt.dat file to refer to solutions and reactions 
	defined in the PHREEQC input file. For example, the grid might be 
	defined to have SOLUTION 2 as the initial condition, where SOLUTION 2 
	is defined in the PHREEQC input file. 	

	For simulations without chemistry--flow or flow and heat--only the 
	vs2drt.dat file	is needed. 

	The VS2DRT batch versions are run by using a command prompt window. 
	Change directories to the directory containing the input files and 
	invoke the program. 

Nonparallel:
	INSTALL/bin/vs2drt.exe   	

OpenMP: 

	To run the OpenMP version using the file names shown in this README, the 
	executable would be found as follows: 

	INSTALL/bin/vs2drt_openmp.exe [processes]  

	The number of threads to be used in parallel processing may
	be defined as an optional argument. 

MPI:

	To run the MPI version of VS2DRT, it is necessary to use the mpiexec command at a 
	command prompt. A simple example of running the MPI version of VS2DRT follows:

    mpiexec -n 4 INSTALL/bin/vs2drt_mpi.exe
      
    where 4 is the number of processes to use for parallel processing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
E. Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Example problems are included in the examples directory of the installation.  The
examples are segregated into directories for flow (flow only), energy (flow and heat),
solute (flow and solute), and solute-energy (flow, heat, and solute). In addition,
there is another example in the directory tutorial1.
